* $122 \times 40 = 4880$ events flow to the event service.
* The workload is skewed - all events flow to a specific instance.

## Conclustion
* The completion time does not have much difference.
* The instance under skewed workload processes around $4880$ events, around $2.4\%$ of all reservations. This small fraction explains why the completion time remains nearly unchanged ‚Äî most reservations are handled by the ticket and reservation services, which do not experience workload skew.
* More reservations are directly rejected by the reservation service under skewed workload, which explains the observed reduction in latency.
